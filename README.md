# Unity Starter Package 

This repository contains a collection of scripts and assets for game development in Unity 6. 
It has been created for game development classes at the University of Florida's **Digital Worlds Institute**. 

Included is...
- A collection of scripts for a 2D side-scrolling or top-down game. 
- A collection of scripts for a 3D first-person or third-person game. 
- A dialogue system for use in 2D or 3D. 
- Documention PDFs for each script collection. 

All scripts were written by Logan Kemper. Feel free to use, fork, remix, or share however you would like. 

## How to Use

- Create a new 2D or 3D Unity 6 project using the Universal Render Pipeline. The package was last tested with Unity 6.3. 
- Import TextMesh Pro. In the scene hierarchy, `right-click > UI > Text - TextMesh Pro`. If it's not in the project yet, a TMP Importer dialogue will pop up. Choose `Import TMP Essentials`. 
- Download the desired `.unitypackage` files from this repo. Import them to Unity by choosing `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...` then select the `.unitypackage` file. Make sure everything is checked on and click `Import`. 
- Note that this starter package uses Unity's Input Manager for input. Under `Edit > Project Settings... > Player > Other Settings`, make sure `Active Input Handling` is set to `Both` or `Input Manager (Old)`. 
- Check out the example scenes to see the scripts in action!
