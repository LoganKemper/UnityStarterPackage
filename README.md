# Unity Starter Package 

This repository contains a collection of scripts and assets for game development in Unity 6. 
It has been created for game development classes at the University of Florida's Digital Worlds Institute. 

Included is...
- A collection of scripts for a 2D platformer/sidescroller game. 
- A collection of scripts for a 3D first-person or third-person game. 
- A dialogue system for use in 2D or 3D. 
- Documention PDFs for each script collection. 

The assets were created for use with Unity 6 and its Universal Render Pipeline and the Input Manager. 

All scripts were written by Logan Kemper unless noted otherwise. Feel free to use or share however you like.
