# Unity Starter Package 

This repository contains a collection of scripts and assets for game development in Unity 6. 
It has been created for game development classes at the University of Florida's Digital Worlds Institute. 

Included is...
- A collection of scripts for a 2D side-scrolling or top-down game. 
- A collection of scripts for a 3D first-person or third-person game. 
- A dialogue system for use in 2D or 3D. 
- Documention PDFs for each script collection. 

All scripts were written by Logan Kemper unless noted otherwise. Feel free to use, fork, remix, or share however you like. 

## How to Use

- Create a new 2D or 3D Unity 6 project using the Universal Render Pipeline. The package was last tested with Unity 6000.0.36f1. 
- Import TextMesh Pro. In the scene hierarchy, right-click > UI > Text - TextMesh Pro. If it's not in the project yet, a TMP Importer dialogue will pop up. Choose "Import TMP Essentials". 
- Download the desired .unitypackage files from this repo. Import them to Unity by choosing Assets > Import Package > Custom Package... then select the .unitypackage file. Make sure everything is checked on and click "Import". 
- Check out the example scenes to see the scripts in action! 
- Note that this starter package uses Unity's Input Manager for input. Under Edit > Project Settings... > Player > Other Settings, make sure Active Input Handling is set to "Both" or "Input Manager (Old)".
